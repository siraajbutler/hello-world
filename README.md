# hello-world
This an IT Analysis Design 
I am a Software Developer, Applied Computer Science. I can create anything from Java to PHP. I also want to create databases that can retrieve data and send data. Though I am better at Java than I am at anything. I create code to imitate Code thats already been created. Like maring-song.java, Random.java, And Arrays.
